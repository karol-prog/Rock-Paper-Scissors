Hello everyone,

I wanted to improve my JavaScript skills, so I decided to create a simple game to practice what I had learned. I made a rock-paper-scissors game, which helped me understand how functions work with parameters, how if statements work, how the random method works with arrays, and some basic DOM manipulations to interact with the website. It was challenging for me to create this game, but I learned a lot through the process.

You can check out the game live here. https://karol-rps.netlify.app/

Happy coding. See you later.
